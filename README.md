# Netflix Content Popularity Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, our goal is to analyze the factors that contribute to the popularity of Netflix content. We aim to gain insights into user preferences to inform content recommendations and strategies that enhance viewer satisfaction and engagement. By examining ratings and watchtime, we aim to uncover user engagement patterns, preferences, and the factors contributing to the perceived quality of content on Netflix. This information can be leveraged to enhance content recommendations, improve overall viewer satisfaction, and inform future content creation strategies.

## Key Metrics and Benchmarks

Popularity refers to the degree to which a movie, TV show, or any other content attracts attention, interest, and engagement from a large audience over a given period. In the context of Netflix, popularity can be measured through various metrics such as the number of views, user ratings, watchtime, and the frequency of recommendations. Popularity may be influenced by:
- Quality of content
- Genre and theme
- Marketing
- Social influence
- Relevance to current events

**Ratings** refer to the numerical scores or assessments provided by users to movies, TV shows, or other content available on Netflix. Netflix publishes weekly global Top 10 lists for films and TV based on the number of views that week (views for a title is defined as the total hours viewed divided by the total runtime and rounded to 100,000).

**Watchtime** refers to the total amount of time users spend watching a particular movie, TV show, or any other content. It includes metrics like total watchtime, average watchtime, completion rate, session duration, and peak viewing times.

## How to Use IMDb API to Get Ratings

To enrich your dataset with IMDb ratings, follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve IMDb Ratings:** Use the IMDb API to fetch ratings for each title in your dataset.
2. **Merge Ratings with Dataset:** Merge the fetched ratings with your existing dataset based on unique identifiers (e.g., IMDb ID).
3. **Clean and Preprocess Data:** Ensure consistency in the ratings data and handle any missing or erroneous values.
4. **Incorporate Ratings into Analysis:** Use the IMDb ratings to enhance your analysis of user engagement and content popularity.
